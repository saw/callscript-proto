title: Vote NO on extreme alt-right Britt Grant for a lifetime appointment to the federal appeals court.
date: 2017-06-17
office: Senate

Britt Grant has been nominated by Trump for a lifetime judgeship to the federal appeals court. She has a troubling record of far right wing views. As a lawyer Grant has opposed:
* Women’s reproductive rights and Roe v. Wade
* Common sense gun safety
* Voters’ rights
* ACA and federal aid for health insurance
* Same sex marriage and LGBT equality
* DACA program
* Environmental protection laws

Grant has only 11 years of courtroom experience, when the ABA guidelines recommend a minimum of 12 years experience for a federal judge. 

Last year Grant was appointed to the Georgia Supreme Court by Georgia’s Republican Governor. She had no previous experience as a judge whatsoever. Now she is being nominated to a lifetime appointment to a federal appeals court that is only one step below the U.S. Supreme Court.

At only 40 years of age, she will be an extremely conservative judge for a very long time, a position for which she is both unfit and unqualified.[Indivisible East Bay](https://indivisibleeb.org/judiciary/monitoring-nominees/grant/​)
