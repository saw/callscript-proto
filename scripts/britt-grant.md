​I’m calling to ask the Senator to vote No on the nomination of Britt Grant for a lifetime judgeship on the federal appeals court. Grant has a troubling record of far right wing views, and I’m concerned she will be a biased judge. She also lacks sufficient courtroom experience, per ABA guidelines, and, as such, is unqualified to be a federal judge.
