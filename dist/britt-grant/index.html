<p>Britt Grant has been nominated by Trump for a lifetime judgeship to the federal appeals court. She has a troubling record of far right wing views. As a lawyer Grant has opposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women’s reproductive rights and Roe v. Wade</li>
<li>Common sense gun safety</li>
<li>Voters’ rights</li>
<li>ACA and federal aid for health insurance</li>
<li>Same sex marriage and LGBT equality</li>
<li>DACA program</li>
<li>Environmental protection laws</li>
</ul>
<p>Grant has only 11 years of courtroom experience, when the ABA guidelines recommend a minimum of 12 years experience for a federal judge. </p>
<p>Last year Grant was appointed to the Georgia Supreme Court by Georgia’s Republican Governor. She had no previous experience as a judge whatsoever. Now she is being nominated to a lifetime appointment to a federal appeals court that is only one step below the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>At only 40 years of age, she will be an extremely conservative judge for a very long time, a position for which she is both unfit and unqualified.<a href="https://indivisibleeb.org/judiciary/monitoring-nominees/grant/​">Indivisible East Bay</a></p>
