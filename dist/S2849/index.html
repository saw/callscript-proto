<p>In a recent statement the United Nations human rights office declared that separating children from migrant families entering the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/world/americas/us-un-migrant-children-families.html">violates their rights and international law</a>. Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated that “[this practice]amounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life, and is a serious violation of the rights of the child.”</p>
<p>The United States maintains the largest immigration detention infrastructure in the world, detaining approximately 380,000 to 442,000 persons per year. Persons, including legal permanent residents with longstanding family and community ties, asylum-seekers, and victims of human trafficking–are detained for weeks, months, and sometimes years. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detains women, men, children, and LGBTQ individuals in over 200 county jails and for-profit prisons.</p>
<p>Detention cost taxpayers approximately $2 billion in 2015. On average taxpayers spend $90.43/day ($33,000/annually) to detain a person in a private immigration detention facility and $72.69/day ($26,500/annually) in a municipal jail. ($30,000 a year is roughly the annual cost of sending a kid to a public college, so that $2bn could provide a full college education to 66,666 students.) </p>
<p>Because there is no independent oversight of the detention system inmates are vulnerable to abuse. Immigrants in detention facilities around the United States are often subjected to punitive and long-term solitary confinement. They are subject to inadequate medical care, vulnerable to rape and assault, and often isolated from access to legal assistance and community support. An internal ICE report concluded that there were “problems that undermine the protection of detainees’ rights, their humane treatment, and the provision of a safe and healthy environment.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, June 3, U.S. Senator Merkley attempted to inspect a privately run juvenile detention center in a converted Walmart store with blacked out windows where hundreds of children were said to be held prisoner. Merkley had previously been allowed to enter a DHS-run facility where he reported that he saw men, women and children crowded in cages. "It reminds me a little bit of a dog kennel, constructed of cyclone fencing," he said. Merkley was threatened with arrest when he attempted a similar unannounced inspection of the privately-run center. </p>
